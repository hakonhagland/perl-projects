# Perl project ideas

- Looking for a way to contribute to open source and Perl? Check out the
project ideas below.

- Want to collaborate on a project? Submit an issue here describing your
  idea and I will consider adding it to the list of project below; or better: do
  the work yourself and submit a pull request here which provides a link to your
  GitHub project page. I will then consider merging into the list of
  projects below.

  - The project page should explain the purpose of the project and refer to a GitHub
  repository with source
  code, see [this](https://github.com/hakonhagland/perl-qt5-project)
  page for an example.

  - The only requirement is that you (or one of the collaborators
  listed on the project page) are available to
  respond to pull request and issues submitted to your project page
  and your project source code repository.
