# Perl project ideas

- Looking for ways to contribute to, or collaborate on, open source
projects with Perl? Check out the project ideas below.

- Do you have a new project idea? Submit an issue here describing your
  idea and I will consider adding it to the list of project below; or better: do
  the work yourself and submit a pull request here which provides a link to your
  GitHub project page. I will then consider merging it into the list of
  projects below.

  - The project page should explain the purpose of the project and refer to a GitHub
  repository with source
  code, see [this](https://github.com/hakonhagland/perl-qt5-project)
  page for an example.

  - The only requirement is that you (or one of the collaborators
  listed on the project page) are available to
  respond to pull request and issues submitted to your project page
  and your project source code repository.

  - Even if you don't expect anyone to be able to contribute to your
    project, you could still create a project page, since this
    provides a place where others can provide feedback on your project.

- Do you have limited time to contribute? If you do not have time to
  contribute, maybe you have time to provide a short feedback on the
  project's project site? For example,

  - if the project is a good idea or not,
  - things you would like the contributors to focus on,
  - other ideas ...
