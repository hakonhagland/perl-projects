# Perl project ideas

- Looking for a way to contribute to open source and Perl? Check out the
project ideas below.

- Want to collaborate on a project? Submit a pull request here, or open an
  issue and provide a link to your GitHub project page.

  - The project page should explain the purpose of the project and refer to a GitHub
  repository with source
  code, see [this](https://github.com/hakonhagland/perl-qt5-project)
  page for an example.

  - The only requirement is that you (or
  other one of the collaborators listed on the project page) are available to
  respond to pull request and issues submitted to your project page
  and your project source code repository.
